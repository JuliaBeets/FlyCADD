# Scripts FlyCADD 
This directory contains the scripts, tools and workflow used to create the FlyCADD-model for predicting the impact of single nucleotide variation in *Drosophila melanogaster*.

For the whole pipeline, an unmasked reference genome and an alignment file in `.maf` format are used, except when specified otherwise.
